# About {#sec-About}
Welcome to the Break Through Tech x Relativity 1B Bias Detection Project repository! This repository serves as the central hub for all code, documentation, and resources related to our project, which focuses on identifying and mitigating bias in machine learning models.

Our project is part of the Break Through Tech AI Program, where we work in collaboration with Relativity to tackle the issue of bias in AI models. We are developing tools and methodologies to analyze models, uncover inherent biases, and explore strategies to reduce or eliminate these biases.
